## Project Overview

### What is Aquarius?
Aquarius is a conceptual design for a water quality tester that was developed during my final year of university. The aim behind the product is to solve the problem of sewage contamination affecting regular water users as well as the local environment.

The product is designed with swimmers and surfers in mind, allowing them to rapidly and easily test water quality due to it's use a microfluidics technology and intuitive user interface.

### Project Conception
Since Aquarius is still a conceptual design and requires at least 2 more years of work to get into production, a start up site felt fitting. It brings awareness to the product as well as the key problem at hand and begins the marketing campaign without having a physical product ready to sell.

Below are the initial pen & paper wireframes for the site:

## User Experience **_turn these into personas_**

### **Project Goals**
The primary goal of the site is to provide a simple and informative interface where user's can learn about the product and it's journey through development as well as sign up to receive updates on the product. Aquarius has two target audiences:
1. Water users such as, surfers, wild swimmers and kayakers.
2. Charities or agencies involved in water sports or coastal/ river environments.

### **User Scenario One**:
**User:** Wild Swimmer, 26,  based in Penzance

**Their Goals:**
* Understand the affects of sewage contamination
* Learn how Aquarius can benefit them
* Find out more about the progress of Aquarius
* Find out what they can do *now* to help in the fight against sewage contamination

**How the site helps them:**
* Explains, with data, the impact sewage contamination has on water users
* Provides information about the Aquarius product
* Shows the journey of Aquarius from problem to product
* Provides a newsletter sign up to find out more about Aquarius' progress
* Provides information on virtual, local and national causes against sewage contamination

### **User Scenario Two**:
**User:** Charity Worker, 38, based in Bournemouth

**Their Goals:**
* Learn how Aquarius could benefit their organisation and the public
* Enquire about a collaboration or bulk order
* Find out more about the progress of Aquarius

**How the site helps them:**
* Provides information about the Aquarius product
* Provides a newsletter sign up to find out more about Aquarius' progress
* Provides contact information for collaborations and pre-orders

### **Wireframes**

Sign Up Page:

### **Wireframe Testing**

The above wireframes were tested with two users to collect their thoughts and opinions on the current site layout as well as what they thought could be improved to make the site more user-friendly. Without specific site content, they both felt it was difficult to visualise the site, therefore once the main structure of the site is developed, the site will be tested with them again to finalise areas for improvement.

Both users did notice a lot of text on the site, which on the dekstop version was fine, however, on the mobile and tablet versions they felt it was a lot of undigestable content. The wireframes were updated to represent text as a mixture of paragraphs and lists to ensure that during site development this would be kept in mind. Screen sizes have also been added to the wireframes to show what content is shown on the initial view of each page.

## Design

### Colours
Aquarius already has a colour scheme designed into the product itself consisting of #4CADAA and #ABABAB, so it made sense to keep the original two colours and add accent colours around those to keep the site and product images within the same theme.

Here are the shades of the original accent colour from Aquarius, the colours that will be tested are highlighted in yellow.

![alt text](assets/img/blue_colours_2023_03_08.png "Blue Colour Scheme")

Here are the shades of the original base colour from Aquarius, the colours that will be tested are highlighted in yellow.

![alt text](assets/img/grey_colours_2023_03_08.png "Grey Colour Scheme")

Various combinations of the chosen six colours were tested using Adobe Colour's accessibility tools, below are the three combinations that passed the minimum colour contrast ratio check.

![alt text](assets/img/contrast_colours_1_2023_03_08.png "Dark Blue on Off White")

![alt text](assets/img/contrast_colours_2_2023_03_08.png "Bright Blue on Dark Blue")

![alt text](assets/img/contrast_colours_3_2023_03_08.png "Off White on Dark Blue")

Here is the final colour scheme for the site:

The lightest blue was changed to a slightly lighter colour since when it was placed within the colour scheme it felt to neon.

![alt text](assets/img/final_colour_scheme_2023_03_08.png "Chosen Colour Scheme")

Colour Assignments:
* Dark Blue #306E6C - Header and footer background
* Bright Blue #A1FAF5 - Hyperlinks, hovers, clicked links
* Mid Blue #4CADAA - Icons, graphics **_need to incorporate this colour more into site_**
* Dark Grey #595959 - Bulk text
* Off White #F7F7F7 - Site background, text on dark blue

### Typography
The Aquarius logo consists of Futura, however this is not a Google Font so is less likely the user will actually be able to view the font, it's also overused and common within industry for a company to use a different font from it's logo. Therefore, the chosen fonts for this site are Google Fonts: Fjalla One and Oxygen.

Fjalla One will be used for headers, taglines and navigation, the following screenshots show testing of Fjalla One in standard case and uppercase. Uppercase will be used for the navigation and standard case will be used within page content.

![alt text](assets/img/fjalla_one_test_1.png "Standard Case Font Testing")

![alt text](assets/img/fjalla_one_test_2.png "Uppercase Font Testing")

Oxygen will be used for paragraph text, links and the footer, the following screenshot shows testing of Oxygen at 16px, browser default.

## Project Management

### Languages Used
* HTML5
* CSS3

### Version Control
During site development GitHub was used to manage versions of each file, commits were made often and consisted of small bite-sized edits to individual features to make it easier to roll back the site to a previous version, if required. Since this was my first project completed using HTML and CSS, there was a steep learning curve and many coding sessions that didn't feel as productive as I'd hoped and others that were much easier than anticipated, this can be seen in the commits shown below.

## Site Features

### **Universal Site Elements**

### External Links Used Across Site
Bootstrap CSS framework was used throughout the site to aid in developing a responsive, well-laid out website. This framework allowed the main structure of the site to be developed quickly, therefore more time could be spent appropriately styling the site and fine tuning elements.

Font Awesome icons were used for the social links in the footer as well as for the animated arrow on the front cover of the home page. These icons allowed for simple and understandable graphics to be added to the site without the need to manually generate them.

Two Google fonts were used throughout the site: Fjalla One and Oxygen. Details on the choice of these fonts can be found in the [Typography](#typography) section above.

### Header & Main Navigation
The header of the site consists of the Aquarius logo on the left and the primary site navigation on the right. On the home page the header has a transparent background so it sits on top of the cover image. Once the user begins to scroll the background transitions to dark blue with a slight drop shadow. On all other site pages, the header has the dark blue background colour and the transition has been removed.

On screen sizes smaller than 576px wide (**_bootstrap breakpoint_**) the main navigation will become a hamburger button that can be toggled to show the navigation in a dropdown format.

Site header on screens 576px and above:

Site header on screens below 576px:

### Footer
The footer consists of copyright information on the left and social links on the right all on a dark blue background.

On screen sizes below 576px wide, the two columns of content stack and float on the right-hand side of the footer.

### Home (index.html)
The home page begins with a cover image of the aquarius product that takes up the whole height of the screen. This was done using: 'height: 100vh;'.

In the top left of the image is a tagline about the Aquarius product to introduce the user to the product and indicate what is in the image they are currently looking at. This was positioned using 'position: absolute;' to place it neatly within the cover image. On screens beneath **_768px_** a grey box is applied behind the tagline to make it visible against the background. This is because on these screens the white in the image sits behind the text, making it difficult to read.

Since this image took up the whole height of the screen, an animated arrow was added to the bottom centre of the image to indicate to the user that they can scroll down for more content. This arrow is the font awesome icon: 'fa fa-chevron-down' and was animated using 'bounce' with keyframes to control the exact movement of the arrow. It was positioned using 'position: relative;' to place it at the bottom centre of the cover image.

Cover image, text and arrow at 576px wide:

Cover image, text and arrow at 992px wide:

The home page content was structured using bootstrap rows and columns with the custom classes 'img-width-100' and 'img-height-100' to ensure images took up the full height or width of the column/ row they were in.

On screen sizes below 992px wide 'class*' was used to target all 'col-md-' elements and make them 'width: 100%;' so that columns would be stacked on smaller screen sizes to make the content easier to digest.

Also, the Microfluidic Technology paragraph was quite long and became problematic on smaller screen sizes as it was a lot of text. Therefore, to make the content easier to digest on smaller screens, the bulleted list from that paragraph was removed on screens below 992px wide.

### Our Journey (about.html)
The first section of the about page is a centred paragraph explaining how the Aquarius product came to be, followed by three images illustrating the final prototype of Aquarius along with the testing that went into the development of Aquarius.

The images were placed in three columns of equal width within a single row. Unlike the home page, these columns do not stack on screens beneath 992px because that would of left a lot of imagery to scroll through to get to the text beneath. Instead these images are set to a width of 33% on screens beneath 992px wide to prevent them from stacking, and then on screens beneath 576px wide, they are hidden as they become too small to fully understand the content.

About header on screen size 1200px wide:

About header on screen size 576px wide:

Similar to the header of the about page, the rest of the imagery is contained in rows and then either two or three columns depending on the amount of images in a section. These columns are still set to stack on screens below 992px wide, so that the content is still visible on these screen sizes.

In the 'Developed Through Testing' section, there is an mp4 video with controls showing a small snippet of the testing process of the Aquarius product. On screens above 992px wide it is 33% of the screen width and on screens 992px wide and smaller it also stacks with the images included in that section.

### Support (support.html)
The support page begins with three columns containing information about how users can support the fight against sewage contamination. Each column contains an image, header and short paragraph that will stack on screens 992px wide and below.

Ways to support the cause on screen size 1200px:

Ways to support the cause on screen size 576px:

At the bottom of the support page is a form for users send enquiries about collaborating with the Aquarius product, this is intended for users that want to create content containing the Aquarius product, place a wholesale order or anything other enquiries really.

The form contains a field for first name, last name, email address and the user's message. It is centred on the page at 70% of the screen width, however on screen sizes over 1200px wide, it is set to 840px wide and a calculation is used to keep the margin left at half the size of the screen size minus the 840px for the form itself. This prevents the form from growing too large on wide screen monitors.

Collaboration form on screen size 1800px:

### Sign Up (signup.html)
On the Sign Up page, the first feature is the subscribe form for users to enter their name and email address to sign up to the Aquarius newsletter for updates on the product. Similar to the collaboration form on the Support page, this form has the same style attributes to determine it's size, font and colours.

Subscribe form on screen size 1800px:

Subscribe form on screen size 576px:

Upon completion of either form on the site, the user is directed to a Thank You page, indicating their response from the form has been recorded. This page still contains the site header, navigation bar and footer, meaning the user never leaves the site and can still return to read more information about Aquarius.

Thank You page on screen size 1200px:

The same full width image is used at the bottom of the Sign Up page and the Thank You page to keep the same styling between the pages for ease of use as well as tie the pages into the overall theme of the site.

The image has been made full width by not placing it within a bootstrap row or column and using the 'img-width-100' class.
